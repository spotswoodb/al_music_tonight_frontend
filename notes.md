Is this how I should be setting up my code i.e. is it the most efficient way?

How do I get my image to appear?

Working on event form for adding a new event to a venue...

I should probably create a createEvent method instead of doing everything in the event class?

Why doesn't ${this.url} + '/venues' work in venueService createVenue function?

How do I make this the cornerstone of my portfolio thus far?

I need have event.js handle everything to do with events... this.all_events in Venue.js(27) is not going to work
