AL Music Tonight

Overview
In addition to learning web development, I am a musician in Alabama. I've heard from many of my friends that it'd be nice to have a site that shows all the live music that's available on a given weekend. I set out to create something that solves this problem and allows users to add their own venues and events. This way, anyone can share their live music experience in Alabama. The application is a work in progress. I plan to add state-wide functionality for all cities in Alabama after having users test the application. 

Configuration
This application uses the powers of JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and Active Record.
- Ruby 2.6.1
- PostgreSQL 13.4

Copy and past the following in your terminal: git clone git@github.com:spotswoodb/al_music_tonight_frontend.git. Continue by typing 'cd al_music_tonight_frontend' to enter the al_music_tonight_frontend folder. You will also need to visit https://github.com/spotswoodb/al_music_tonight in order to access the associated PostgreSQL database or copy and paste the following in your terminal: git@github.com:spotswoodb/al_music_tonight.git.
